Functionality:

The script prompts the user to input a message and a shift value (from 1 to 25).
It then encrypts the message using the caesar_cipher function and prints the result.
After that, the script decrypts the encrypted message using the caesar_decipher function and prints the decrypted result to verify the correctness.
Interactive:

The user can input different messages and shifts to see how the Caesar cipher works in real time.
This is ideal for demonstrating how the encryption and decryption processes work with varying inputs.


Running the Demo:
To run the demo, use the following command in your terminal:

( bash )
python examples/demo.py


*Example Interaction:*
( yaml )

Enter message to encrypt: Hello, World!
Enter shift value (1-25): 3
Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!
Decrypted message: Hello, World!
